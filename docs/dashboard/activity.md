# Activity Insights

---

The Arcpay **Activity Dashboard** provides developers and project teams with real-time data on transaction history and performance. Use these insights to improve your platform’s operational efficiency and make data-driven decisions:

- **Monthly Volume**: Track the total network and currency tokens transacted this month. This helps you gauge overall sales performance and customer preferences.
- **Transactions This Week**: A visual graph showing the number of transactions processed over the past week, giving you a clear view of daily activity trends.
- **Latest Transactions**: Stay updated with a detailed list of recent transactions, including transaction type (create, buy, cancelled), the buyer, and clickable links to view individual transaction or asset details.

This data allows you to stay on top of transaction activity, monitor customer behavior, and optimize your offerings accordingly. With minute by minute **real-time updates**, you’ll always have the latest metrics to guide your next steps.
