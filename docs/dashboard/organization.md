# Organization Management

---

Arcpay enables project teams to create and manage organizations for streamlined transaction handling and collaboration. With the **Organization Management** features, you can control asset listings, assign team roles, and link wallets to your organizationâ€”all through an intuitive interface.

## Creating and Managing an Organization

Follow these steps to create and manage an organization for your project:

1. **Create a New Organization**: From the **Dashboard**, click **Create new organization**. This allows you to group assets, listings, and transactions under a shared management structure.
2. **Link an Address**: In the **Settings** menu, you can link an AVM address to your organization, enabling secure transaction handling. This address will be used for all organizational transactions.
3. **Assign Roles**: Within the organization, define team roles such as Admin or Member, to ensure proper permissions for listing management and transaction oversight.

## Managing Listings within Your Organization

Arcpay allows your organization to easily create and manage listings for assets such as NFTs, SFTs, and RWAs.

1. **View All Listings**: Access the **Listings** section from the left-hand menu in the dashboard. Here, you can monitor all active listings created by your organization.
2. **Create New Listings**: Set up new listings with just a few clicks, specifying the asset, listing type (Sale, Auction, Reverse Auction), and pricing. All listings are managed centrally, giving you full control over your organization's assets.
3. **Edit and Cancel Listings**: You can update or cancel existing listings from the dashboard at any time. This flexibility allows you to respond quickly to market demands or project changes.
