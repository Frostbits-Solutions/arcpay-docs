# IPFS Gateway Access

Arcpay leverages Nodely's robust and distributed IPFS gateway to provide seamless access to your files stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). This integration, powered by Nodely's infrastructure and technology, allows for efficient and reliable retrieval of your content, enhancing the overall user experience.

## How to Access Your Content via the IPFS Gateway

To access your content through the Arcpay IPFS gateway, you'll need to whitelist your domain with Nodely. Here's how:

1. **Identify Your Domain:** Determine the domain name through which you intend to access your IPFS content.

2. **Contact Nodely Support:**  Nodely requires domain whitelisting for IPFS gateway access. Please contact their support team at `support@nodely.io` with your domain whitelisting request. They will add your domain free of charge. You can find more information about Nodely's IPFS gateway, including usage requirements and restrictions, on their [IPFS documentation page](https://nodely.io/docs/public/ipfs/).

## Benefits of Nodely's IPFS Gateway

* **Algorand Asset Support:** The gateway is specifically designed to support Algorand assets, facilitating smooth interaction with content related to the Algorand blockchain.
* **Enhanced Security:** Domain whitelisting enhances security by restricting access to authorized users, preventing abuse and protecting your content.
