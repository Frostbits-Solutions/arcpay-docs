# Listing Types

Arcpay supports three types of listings across AVM networks:

## 1. Sale (Fixed Price Sale)

- A **Fixed Price Sale** allows you to list a tokenized or non-tokenized asset at a set price.
::: tip Use Case
Selling a high-demand product like a digital collectible or merchandise, where the price remains constant, and buyers can immediately purchase.
:::

## 2. Auction (English Auction)

- The **Auction** format allows you to set a starting bid for a tokenized asset.
- The price will increase after each bid, and the auction ends when the specified duration expires.
::: tip Use Case
Auctioning a rare or limited-edition NFT, where competitive bidding could drive up the final sale price.
:::

## 3. Reverse (Dutch Auction)

- The **Reverse** format starts with a high price for a tokenized asset that decreases over time.
- The price drops every block until the minimum price is reached or the auction duration expires.
::: tip Use Case
Perfect for selling digital assets or NFTs where initial demand is uncertain. This format encourages buyers to act quickly, fearing the item might sell before it reaches its lowest price.
